"Not all wanderers are lost"

Hello, welcome to my personal webpage. My name is Yuxun Guo (郭宇栒). I am a theoretical physicst studying the internal structures of the nucleon in terms of its elementary degrees of freedom, i.e., quarks and gluons. I am current a postdoc at Nuclear Theory Group, Nuclear Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I got my Ph.D. in physics at University of Maryland, college park in 2023, and before that I got my B.S. in physics at Tsinghua University, Beijing in 2018.
